## The MEAN stack

When I first got asked to write a blog post about the MEAN stack I was forced to confront a horrible truth, my job is
a black box. Or rather Pandora's Box, once I describe the MEAN stack I will have to describe every little nuance and 
related piece of technology and I will hurt a lot of people. This, for most people, would not be a *fun read* so I've 
decided against giving a description of the MEAN stack, instead I want to give you an idea of how the MEAN stack 
changed my life.

## What does my day look like?

My day starts the same as any other person, I open my eyes, get out of bed; but unlike every other person I get up in 
the morning and start hurrying! I get the kids ready, grab a piece of bread and run upstairs to get to my computer. I 
boot my computer up and get to work.

Just to clarify, my computer is not my friend. I do not see the computer as a living entity, my computer is an 
extension of my mind. I exert my will through my computer into a world which is not a part of daily reality and at 
the same time it is where we spend most of our time.

After my computer had booted up, which is three seconds because I use a Mac, I immediately open a few programmes. I 
open my IDE (integrated development environment), my terminal and my browser. These are the only things *I* need to get 
going. Before I take a sip of my coffee my three essential applications are running and I'm ready to start my 
working day. Now I have to admit, I know people who also open their e-mail and social media, but I do not bend that 
way. I try to limit my contact with other people on the internet to a simple exchange of knowledge and games. 

## What do I do?

I am a programmer. This means that I write "algorithms" in order to automate processes. This in and of itself is a 
useless profession. The only reason I write these "algorithms" is to make other people's working lives easier and 
as a result better.

A better way to understand what I do is to think in terms of small vs. large. I write little words in a man made
logical language to create large effects. I get absolute feedback from my machine every minute or so. Every
minute I will have had a confirmation of my success or a description of my failure from which I can immediate 
extrapolate my subsequent actions. Most of these subsequent actions will again result in immediate feedback. 

My entire day is spend in a feedback loop which is faster than the anyone can reasonably understand. This is the reason 
why discussions between programmers are usually incomprehensible and flat out boring. We tend to push this constant 
stream of "good" vs "bad" assumptions out into every part of our daily lives.

We are feedback junkies. This is why we need to work in a team, this is why we cannot communicate with "the outside 
world", this is why our ability to plan our tasks is nonexistent. There are no nuances anymore. Everything is either 
right or wrong, there is absolutely, categorically, no middle ground.

## But what about the MEAN stack?

Imagine you are a feedback-junkie. Now imagine a way to get your feedback fix even faster! This is what the MEAN stack
is. It is a way to give me my feedback-fix at twenty second intervals. About three times as fast. Getting feedback 
three times as fast makes development about three times as fast. The quality of my code gets better and as a result the 
quality of the overall product gets better.

Because of this faster feedback loop we can have tests run continuously while we type, we can deploy twice a day to 
test environments and we have time to experiment to boot! The MEAN stack, because of these reasons, has been a driving
force behind innovation and startups.
