# The long an winding road

This is not a *vim* love story. Vim is not something you can come to organically in this GUI driven world 
we cyber enthousiasts live in. However, command line tools do fill a void and this document is written to give a little insight in the mind of a simple CLI enthousiast.

I do not like distractions. This is not a problem, it is just a statement of fact. I like to work on a problem until the problem is either solved or I get bored with solving the problem and I move on to the next problem. Distractions are limiting. They split your mind and they allow you to lose focus and focus is what we crave.
